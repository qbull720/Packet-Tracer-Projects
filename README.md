# Network Engineering Portfolio — Packet Tracer Labs

Welcome to my **Network Engineering Portfolio**, a collection of structured Cisco Packet Tracer labs designed to demonstrate practical networking skills, from basic switching to advanced routing and VPN configurations.

Each lab includes:
- 📌 **Topology diagrams**
- 🛠️ **Packet Tracer `.pkt` files**
- 📄 **Lab objectives, commands, and verification outputs**
- 🧭 **Skills demonstrated**

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**
- **Wireshark** (for packet analysis)
- **Draw.io** (for network diagrams)
- **Optional:** Python + Netmiko / Ansible for future network automation
